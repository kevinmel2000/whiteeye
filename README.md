Hello!  This is an Android app that helps screen for leukocoria.

Have you noticed a whitish discolouration of your child’s pupil in dim lighting conditions, from certain angles, or in place of a redeye in flash photos? The child might have leukocoria, the cause of which can be congenital cataract (60%), retinoblastoma (18%), retinal detachment (4.2%), persistent fetal vasculature (4.2%), and Coats disease (4.2%). Untreated retinoblastoma is universally fatal.  The incidence of this alone is 1 in 15,000 live births and leukocoria shows up in more than half the cases.  

Our metrics are based on the research found in this paper:
Abdolvahabi A, Taylor BW, Holden RL, Shaw EV, Kentsis A, et al. (2013) Colorimetric and Longitudinal Analysis of Leukocoria in Recreational Photographs of Children with Retinoblastoma. PLoS ONE 8(10): e76677. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0076677

The centers of the pupils in the leukocoria section of one of the images in the paper were sliced out and batch processed to give each one an average color over the area.
